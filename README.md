## **Session 1 - Working with Jupyter Files**

### **What are Jupyter Notebook Files?**

Jupyter Notebook files (`*.ipynb`) are documents that allow you to combine live code, visualizations, and explanatory text in a single interactive environment. 
These are widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific research.

### **Prerequisites for Working with Jupyter Notebooks**

Before you start working with Jupyter Notebooks, you need to make sure your system is set up with the necessary tools:

#### **1. Python**  
Jupyter Notebooks are built on Python, so you will need to have Python installed on your system. 
You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or use a package manager (like `apt` on Linux or `brew` on macOS).

To check if Python is installed, run the following in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python3 --version
```

#### **2. Pip**
Pip is Python's package installer, used to install external libraries that Jupyter Notebooks often rely on (e.g., numpy, pandas, matplotlib). Make sure pip is installed:

```bash
pip3 --version
```
If pip is not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
python3 -m ensurepip --upgrade
```

#### **3. Requirements**
Install all dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
