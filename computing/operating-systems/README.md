## Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)

**Best Use Cases**:
- Enterprise environments requiring stability and long-term support.
- Large-scale deployments with paid support needs.
- Environments using **Red Hat OpenShift**, **Ansible**, or **Podman**.

**Key Features**:
- Robust support for enterprise-grade applications.
- SELinux for enhanced security.
- Comprehensive ecosystem with **Satellite**, **Insights**, and **Smart Management** tools.
- Certified for use with many cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

**Free RHEL-Based Alternatives**:
If you don't require commercial support but still want to leverage the RHEL ecosystem, consider these free alternatives:
- **CentOS Stream**: A rolling-release version of RHEL, ideal for those testing new features or contributing to RHEL.
- **Fedora**: A cutting-edge, community-driven OS with the latest features and tools, often serving as an upstream source for RHEL.
- **AlmaLinux**: A 1:1 binary-compatible fork of RHEL, maintained by a community-driven foundation, providing long-term stability.
- **Rocky Linux**: Another 1:1 binary-compatible fork of RHEL, designed for those migrating from CentOS.

**Why Choose RHEL?**
- When reliability and commercial support are critical.
- Perfect for enterprises running mission-critical workloads.
- Best for organizations already invested in the **Red Hat ecosystem**.

For users or organizations wanting RHEL-based systems without subscription costs, alternatives like AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux offer free access to the same core functionality and compatibility.
