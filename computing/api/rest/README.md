# Rest API

## REST (representational state transfer) is a set of web API architecture principles. REST APIs, also known as RESTful APIs, are APIs that adhere to certain REST architectural constraints. REST APIs use HTTP requests such as GET, PUT, HEAD and DELETE to interact with resources. REST makes data available as resources, with each resource represented by a unique URI. Clients request a resource by providing its URI. REST APIs are stateless, they do not save client data between requests. Itâ€™s possible to build RESTful APIs with SOAP protocols, but practitioners usually view the two standards as competing specifications.
